                As the world constantly changes, the norms and practices from the past are also changing. Technology plays an important fundamental role in our culture including language, art, and education.

                Culture of a community acts as a norms or standard on how to perceive, judge, and evaluate the technology. The fact that technology affects all aspects of culture, it regulates the direction of cultural growth.

                To preserve cultural values, technology should harmonize with social and cultural criteria of the community. There should exist friction between technological development and cultural values preservation.
