                Since the pandemic, we have tried to adapt to the “new normal” by using technology. We started to use emails, software and websites for school and hospital use. That’s why technology has had a significant impact on the medical field in universities/colleges, and in healthcare. Technology has the use for schools to communicate from remote places and also to continue our education amidst the pandemic. In healthcare, technology can improve patient outcomes, reduce healthcare costs, and transform the way healthcare is delivered.
